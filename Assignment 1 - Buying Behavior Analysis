**Document the number of observations in each category**

# get rid of CT data

# convert all to gallons

**Category Level Analysis**

## Category level analysis

                                   purchase_volume = sum(volume*multi), 
                                   no_households = head(no_households, 1)), 
                               keyby = .(category, year)]

# calculate per capita spend and purchase volume(gal) for each category
purchases_category[, per_cap_spend := spend/no_households]
purchases_category[, per_cap_vol := purchase_volume/no_households]
```

**Graph the evolution of the yearly per capita purchase volume for all four categories.**

```{r}
# plot per capita spend
ggplot(purchases_category, aes(x=year, y=per_cap_spend, color=category)) + geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~category)
# plot per capita purchase volume 
ggplot(purchases_category, aes(x=year, y=per_cap_vol, color=category)) + geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~category)

```


```{r, include=FALSE}
# normalize each category per cap spend and vol against 2004 per cap spend
purchases_category[purchases_category[year==2004,], `:=` 
                   (norm_per_cap_vol = per_cap_vol/i.per_cap_vol, 
                     norm_per_cap_spend=per_cap_spend/i.per_cap_spend), 
                   on="category"]
```


**Graphs, normalized as multiples of 2004 values**

```{r}
ggplot(purchases_category, aes(x=year, y=norm_per_cap_spend, color=category)) + geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~category)

ggplot(purchases_category, aes(x=year, y=norm_per_cap_vol, color=category)) + geom_line() + 
  facet_wrap(~category)
```

**Discussion**

Movement towards being healthier seems to be working. People are buying way more water. On the contrary, soda, diet soda, and other (juices, etc.) are going down. Spend is up on diet and remains constant on "Other" and "Soda", which suggests that companies are increasing their prices to make up for lost volume.

**Brand-Level Analysis**

```{r, include=FALSE}

# merge brand_descr with purchase data
purchases <- merge(purchases, products[, .(upc, upc_ver_uc, brand_descr)])

# calculate total dollar spend by each category/brand description 
brand_summary <- purchases[, .(spend = sum(total_price_paid-coupon_value)),
                          by = .(category, brand_descr)]
```

```{r}
# rank brands by total dollar spend in each category separately
brand_summary[, rank := frankv(spend, order = -1), by = category]
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# merge brand ranking into purchases
# need to set key by brand description AND category because there are blank brand descrs
# in Water and Diet
setkey(purchases,brand_descr, category)
setkey(brand_summary, brand_descr, category)

purchases <- merge(purchases, brand_summary[,.(brand_descr, category, rank)])

# Create total volume spend and total purchase volume for year year/brand combination
purchases_brand <- purchases[rank<=4, .(spend = sum(total_price_paid-coupon_value),
                                    purchase_volume = sum(volume*multi), 
                                    no_households = head(no_households, 1)), 
                                keyby = .(brand_descr, category, year)]

# calculate per capital spend and purchase volume(gal) for each brand
purchases_brand[, per_cap_spend := spend/no_households]
purchases_brand[, per_cap_vol := purchase_volume/no_households]
```

**Plot the evolution of brand volume for the top 4 brands, separately for the CSD, diet CSD, and bottled water categories**
